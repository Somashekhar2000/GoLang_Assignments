Assignment 14: Error Handling with Panic and Recover
Description: In this assignment, you will create a simple program that simulates a situation
where a panic occurs, and you'll use recover and defer to gracefully handle the panic.
Instructions:
1. Write a function called divide that takes two integer arguments, numerator and
denominator. Inside the function, check if the denominator is zero. If it is, intentionally
raise a panic using the panic function with an appropriate error message.
2. Create another function called safeDivide that calls the divide function and uses the
recover function to handle any panics that may occur.
3. In the main function, call safeDivide with different values for the numerator and
denominator. Ensure that you test cases where the denominator is both zero and
non-zero.
4. Use a defer statement in the safeDivide function to recover from any panics and print an
error message instead of crashing the program.
5. Test your program by calling safeDivide with different inputs and observe how it
gracefully handles panics and continues execution.
